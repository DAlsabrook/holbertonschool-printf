.SH NAME
_printf \- prints strings and inserts formatted data

.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "main.h"

int _printf(const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION
_printf() produces a formatted output to stdout, the standard output stream;

This function writes the output under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output.

.SS Format of the format string
The format string of _printf() is a character string, composed of zero or more directives - ordinary characters (not '%') are copied unchanged to the output stream, and conversion specifications fetch a subsequent argument.
Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier.

The arguments must correspond properly with the conversion specifier.
The arguments are used in the order given, where each conversion specifier
asks for the next argument in the list.

.SS Conversion specifiers
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion
specifiers and their meanings are:

.B
.IP [d] [i]
The int argument is converted to decimal notation.
.B
.IP [c]
The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting
character is written.
.B
.IP [s]
The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of
character type (that is, a pointer to a string). Characters from the array
are iterated through and written to the standard output.
.B
.IP [%]
A '%' is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion
specification is '%%'.
.P
.B [any non-specifier]
In a case were a non specifier is passed, eg: "%K", the characters given will be printed along with the % character.

.SH RETURN VALUE
This function returns the number of characters printed to the standard output.

If no input is given or an error is given the function will return 0.

.SH EXAMPLE

.P 
Input: _printf("%s%d!/n", "Hello, from cohort ", 22);
.P
Output: Hello, from cohort 22!
